# 🌦️ Weatherdo — Weather Forecast Web Application

Weatherdo is a dynamic and fully responsive weather forecasting web application built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**.  
It delivers real-time weather forecasts, air pollution indices, breaking news updates, and interactive maps, all while maintaining high accessibility standards through integrated **text-to-speech narration**.  
This project was developed **without using any frameworks or libraries like React.js, Bootstrap, or TailwindCSS**, to strengthen my core web development skills.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary objective behind building Weatherdo was to **master fundamental JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and API integration** techniques, without relying on external frontend frameworks.  
It emphasizes **pure logic building, accessibility enhancements, and clean UI/UX practices**.

If you want, I can also create a **compressed ultra-clean "minimal" version** in case you want a lighter README for GitHub (some devs prefer that!) 🚀🎯  
Would you like that too?
